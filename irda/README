  Introduction
  ------------

  Inspired by wonderfull "ip" utility from iproute2 package by Alexey Kuznetsov,
  I considered that a similar good utility for IrDA networking world will be 
  great.

  Back in 2002 I managed to make a little "irias" utility to manipulate and
  display local IrIAS database. Was very fun and gave me incentive to explore
  the IrDA to the kernel level.

  Linux-IrDA suffer pains for lack of complete and stable tools, if we not 
  count "irdadump" and "irattach".

  The "irda" utility home page is located at:
  
    http://irda.sourceforge.net/irda/
  

  Installing
  ----------

  Because "irda" package use GNU autotools & friends the only thing you should
  do to compile and install is to run:

  ./configure
  make
  make install (as root)



  Using
  -----

  "irda" utility have extensive help for syntax so whenever you stuck with 
  options you don't remember use the "help" keyword. You may also try to
  read the UNIX man page or the full manual.
  
  man 8 irda
