 Installing smcinit
 ==================
 
 Prerequisites
 -------------
 
 To successfully compile and install smcinit package you
 need to:
 
 * have a Linux 2.4.x based system. Prefferably Linux 2.4.18
 kernel or better. 
 
 * have gcc compiler and glibc devel package installed
 
 * have libpci and libpci-devel packages installed
 
 
 Compile & install
 -----------------
 
 Then run:
 
   ./configure
   make
   make install (as root user)
   
   
   
 Notes
 -----
 
 I tested the package on SuSE 8.1 and RedHat 9.0. It should work for any
 recent Linux distribution.
 
  Here are relevant packages to compile on SuSE:
    pciutils-devel-2.1.10-33
    pciutils-2.1.10-33
    libgcc-3.2-39
    gcc-3.2-39
