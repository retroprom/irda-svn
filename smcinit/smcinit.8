.TH SMCINIT "8" "July 2003" "0.3" "Linux IrDA"
.SH NAME
smcinit \- initialize the IrDA controler on Toshiba laptops
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tosh1800-smcinit
or
.B tosh5100-smcinit
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Toshiba Satellite 1800, Satellite 5100, Tecra 9100 laptops 
and may be many other models
are provided with a SMCS LPC47N227 SuperIO chip which is IrDA SIR/FIR capable. 
The IrDA subsystem of the SuperIO chip is supported by the \fBsmc-ircc\fR Linux kernel module. 
Unfortunately the BIOS neither configurates the SuperIO chip IrDA subsystem (SIR port, FIR port, 
dma, irq, IrDA mode, power) nor sets the PCI-ISA bridge to decode any usable port.
Linux kernel is thus prevented to detect the second UART making impossible to use it 
in SIR mode. For the same reason, the FIR mode \fBsmc-ircc\fR is able to detect the SuperIO 
chip but, once found the IrDA subsystem unconfigured, fails to install.
.PP
While this problem will be fixed in Linux 2.6.x kernel series, the 2.4.x users are frustrated.
Daniele Peri, Rob Miller and Paul Hampson mananged to build little utilities
that initialize the LPC47N227 SuperIO allowing smc-ircc IrDA kernel driver 
to detect and use the SMSC chip.
.PP
My sole work was to put these utilities as one package, easy to install and use.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
When system startup a script is run from \fI/etc/init.d\fR and which run appropriate
SMC intialization utility. This is done before PCMCIA startup because on Tecra 9100
the \fBorinoco_cs\fR wireless driver will block the I/O region used 47N227 SuperIO.
.PP
The only configuration file is \fI/etc/sysconfig/smcinit\fR and the variable SMCCONFIG
can be set to "1800" or "5100". By default "5100" value is used.

.B 5100
for Toshiba Satellite 5100 and Toshiba Tecra 9100
.PP
The next step is to configure the kernel IrDA stack package to attach the smc-ircc driver.
This is Linux distribution specific. The main thing is that the device should be set to
"irda0". Run the following command:
.PP
.nf
irattach irda0 -s
.fi
.PP
Distribution specific configuration:
.TP 4
\fBSuSE\fR
Edit the \fI/etc/sysconfig/irda\fR and set IRDA_PORT=irda0 
.TP 4
\fBRedHat\fR
Edit the \fI/etc/sysconfig/irda\fR and set DEVICE=irda0 
.SH NOTES
.PP
The \fBsmc-ircc\fR driver is preloaded in kernel. I tested the package only on Tecra 9100
without any additional step, but for Toshiba Satellite 1800 Daniele Peri 
sugest to put the following line in your \fI/etc/modules.conf\fR (on one line):
.PP
.nf
options smc-ircc ircc_dma=3 ircc_irq=7 ircc_cfg=0x2e \\
        ircc_sir=0x2e8 ircc_fir=0x2f8
.fi
.PP
After that run the command:
.PP
.nf
prompt# depmod -a
.fi
.PP
If the laptop enter suspend mode, then resume operation the \fBsmc-ircc\fR driver will 
stop working. You need to stop IrDA service, then SMCINIT, start SMCINIT, and finally
start IrDA service. Simply put, the kernel driver must be unloaded, then  reloaded.
