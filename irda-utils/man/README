Manual pages for Linux/IrDA, DocBook source files.
(C) 2001 Werner Heuser wehe@mobilix.org
Published under the GPL, see file COPYING for details.


1) docbook-to-man

These SGML sources use `docbook-to-man' to generate man pages.
It's available at http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/tools/dtm/
Or as Debian/GNU-Linux package as well.

!! Note : the docbook-to-man available at the above URL won't format
!! the man pages properly. Use the Debian package. JeanII

2) Document Structure

Each man page consists of two parts:
man-<irda-template>.sgml
man-<irda-template>-inc.sgml

This structure may seem to complicated, but it is used to include the
man pages into the Infrared-HOWTO http://mobilix.org/howtos.html as well.

You may use `docbook-to-man man-[irda-template].sgml > [irda-template].8'
to generate the according man page. See also Makefile.


3) How to Read the Man Pages

Use `man -l FILE' to read the man pages in the current directory.
Or gzip them and copy them to the appropriate man page directory.
See also Makefile.


5) New Issues

See http://mobilix.org/software/irda
for new issues.

4) Criticism

These man pages are not perfect. Please help to make them better.
Your recommendations are welcome.
