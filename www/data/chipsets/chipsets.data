NSC PC87392
http://www.national.com/pf/PC/PC87392.html
PC8739x family of LPC SuperI/O devices is targetted for a wide range 
of portable applications. It integrates 
two enhanced Serial Ports (UARTs), one with Fast Infrared 
(FIR, IrDA 1.1 compliant). 
Is used in the IBM A31
Laptop, probably in many of that series, and other recent IBM Thinkpads.
