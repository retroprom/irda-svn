Site improved structure and design
2003-07-12
Lot of improvements on the site. I tried to recover for more
than on year of inactivity. Here are the changes:
<ul>
  <li>News sections. Yes, you read it!
  <li><a href="sitemap.html">Site map</a> to easy the navigation and overall look
  on site; updated "Credits" section; "Download" sections is more easy to follow
  <li>Desisgn was changed a bit and even the site structure; sectional icons
  are "borrowed" from SVG Crystal theme by Everaldo.
</ul>
I hope you enjoy the new changes!
