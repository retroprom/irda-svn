      Linux-IrDA web site 
      ===================
  
  
  Introduction
  ------------
  
  The Linux-IrDA website make extensive use of Website Meta Language
  written by Ralf S. Engelschall and Denis Barbier. To ease more 
  the dependencies between various files used at site generation,
  Makefile are used as well.
  
  The graphics have been made using Gimp and the XCF source file can
  be found at http://irda.sourceforge.net/ftp/website/
  
  
  Directory structure
  -------------------
  
  Top level directories:
  
  common  - common files, menus, layouts used for all web pages
  data    - content for web pages: news, lists etc.
  html    - where the generated HTML pages goes and image files
            are stored
  wml     - place for WML files; here is a tree of subdirectories 
            which followed be the "html" directory
  
  
  Control files
  -------------
  
  There are two types: "Makefile"s and ".wmlrc"
  
  The toplevel "Makefile" contain lot of targets. You don't have any
  reason to tweak here. "Makefile.cfg" have some variables, just to
  not be forced to change the "Makefile".
  
  The real work "Makefile" is in "wml/Makefile". 
  
  In the HTML_WML_FILES you put any new WML files you add. If you've made
  a new subdirectory, then add it in the variable WWWDIRS. Don't miss to
  add dependecies somewhere to bottom of Makefile. Look arround to see
  examples and figure out.
  
  The toplevel ".wmlrc" control general WML includes searching. The ".wmlrc"s
  from "wml" subdirectories control ROOT variable to allow correct 
  relative HTML links calculation.
  
  
  WML site itself
  ---------------
  
  In the "common" subdirectory are the files:

  chipsets.pl  - a Perl script used in WML step 3 to generate a nice
                 HTML listing from "data/chipsets/chipsets.data" file.
  layout1.inc  - the template for splash HTML page of this site.
  layout2.inc  - the HTML template for any other page from this site.
  menu.inc     - contain the definition of main menu (both graphical
                 and the text one), and any other submenus (graphical
                 or text)
  news.pl      - a Perl script used in WML step 3 to generate a the news
                 list in introduction page and full news listing in 
                 the News section, using "data/news/news1.data" file.
  post-h.inc   - the bottom of HTML pages, containg usually the closing
                 part of <body> tag.
  pre-h.inc    - the top of HTML pages; usually the HEAD part and start
                 of <body> tag.
  tags.inc     - list of all our defined tags which made WML so nice tools;
                 also have includes of WML tag definitions


  Various scripts
  ---------------
  
  "gimp-irda.pl" is Perl Gimp script used by me to automatically generate
  images for submenus. Instead of making tedious hours with Gimp, just
  write the menu names separated by commas.
  
  "sync-wwwirda" is used by me to make a sync between local HTML site 
  and SourceForge hosted one. That way I can be sure the traffic for
  syncing is low and I don't mis any new file
  
  Same apply for "sync-ftpirda". Before running it for first time, 
  please download the  *all* FTP area on your HDD. 
   
    WARNING: It will erase remotely any files you don't have locally!
             You have been warned.
  
  The "sync-wwwirda" and "sync-ftpirda" should be modified according to
  your SF.NET account. Note that from my accound I've made symlinks to
  "irda" project HTTP space.
